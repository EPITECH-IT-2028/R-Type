# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of building and running the R-Type client and server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **CMake**: Version 3.15 or higher.
*   **Conan**: For dependency management.
*   **C++ Compiler**: A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.

## Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EpitechPromo2027/CPP-Advanced_C---R-Type.git
    cd CPP-Advanced_C---R-Type
    ```

2.  **Build the project**

    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```

    This will build both the client and server executables.

## Running the Server

1.  **Run the server:**

    ```bash
    ./r-type_server
    ```

## Running the Client

1.  **Run the client:**

    ```bash
    ./r-type_client
    ```
