\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Packet sent from client to server to report a player hit event. 

Contains the common packet header and the identifying and contextual data for a hit\+: the affected player\textquotesingle{}s id, the damage amount, the world coordinates where the hit occurred, and a sequence number to correlate with client-\/side action/state.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em player\+\_\+id} & Identifier of the player that was hit. \\
\hline
{\em damage} & Amount of damage applied to the player. \\
\hline
{\em x} & World X coordinate where the hit occurred. \\
\hline
{\em y} & World Y coordinate where the hit occurred. \\
\hline
{\em sequence\+\_\+number} & Client-\/side sequence number used to correlate this event with prior actions. \\
